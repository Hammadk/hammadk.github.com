   <title>Mental Models for Product Developers, Part 2: Management</title>

   <updated>2020-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://hammad.ca/blog/2020/07/26/management-mental-models</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://hammad.ca/blog/2017/08/26/engineering-mental-models&quot;&gt;Mental Models for Product Developers series&lt;/a&gt;” and it took me three years to write this post. I hope you weren’t holding your breath! The key insight here is that “management” might be the wrong name for this discipline all together. What you are really doing is growing people. You will rarely have to manage others if you align your interests with the people that report to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to engineering, management is more fuzzy and subjective. This might be why engineers struggle with it. It’s really about calibration; you are calibrating approaches for yourself and your reports. What works for you, might not work for me because the world has different expectations from us. Likewise, just reading books on this stuff doesn’t help because advice from the book is calibrated for the author. With that said, I believe the following mental models are falsifiable. I also believe that doing the opposite of these will always be harmful. I find these particularly valuable while planning my week. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-motivation-by-aligning-incentives&quot;&gt;Create motivation by aligning incentives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incentives drive our behavior above all else. Even the best organized, highest leverage projects will run into hiccupts if the incentives are not aligned. You can solve this by working with your reports to identify the intersection of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do they want to work on?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does the product / team need?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does that company need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic happens when these questions produce themes that overlap with each other; the person will have intrinsic motivation for tasks that build their skills, improve their product, and their company. Working on the two intersecting themes to these questions can be fruitful too. Occasionally you’ll find someone focusing on a task that’s only being done because that’s what the person wants (neglecting the product and the company), only what the product needs (neglecting the person’s needs or the company), or only what the company wants (neglecting the person’s needs or their product). This is fine in the short term, but not a good long term strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this interesting is that the answers to these questions are often at odds with each other. For example, you could have cases where the person wants to do more datastore optimizations, but the most important thing for the product is new features. Another example of this is when the company would want the person to help teach their peers, but the product would need the person to focus on existing issues. You should allow for short term exceptions, but nudge your reports towards overlapping themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/align_incentives.png&quot; alt=&quot;Align incentives&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-clarity-by-understanding-the-why-and-having-a-vision-for-the-product&quot;&gt;Create clarity by understanding the “why” and having a vision for the product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have a vision for where your product needs to go. Doing this ends up being super helpful when deciding between competing tactical options, and also helps clear up general confusion. You should also communicate the vision with your team.  While being a visionary isn’t included in your job description, aligning on a “why” often counteracts the negative effects of broken-telephone effect in communication and entropy in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-high-leverage-activities&quot;&gt;Focus on high leverage activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the central idea in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management&quot;&gt;High output management&lt;/a&gt;. The core idea is similar to the “Pareto principle” where you focus your energy on the 20% of the tasks that have 80% of the impact. If you don’t do this, your team will spend a lot of time, but not accomplish much. So, take some time to plan your approach and focus on the activities that give you the most leverage. I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Leverage_Points.pdf&quot;&gt;Donella Medow’s research&lt;/a&gt; to be a super user for understanding leverage. A few examples of this include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promote-growth-mindset-in-your-team&quot;&gt;Promote growth mindset in your team&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had to start with 0, what you’d want is the ability to acquire new skills. You want to instill a mindset of growth in yourself and the rest of the team. Create  an environment where reflection and failures are talked about. Lessons that you truly learn are the ones that you have learnt by making mistakes. Create an environment where people obsess about the craft and consider failures a learning opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;align-your-team-on-the-common-vision&quot;&gt;Align your team on the common vision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most important things you could do. It’ll mean that people will go in the same general direction. More importantly, it’ll help you avoid situations where people are going in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;build-self-organizing-teams&quot;&gt;Build self-organizing teams&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating self-sufficient teams is the only way to scale yourself. You can enable a team to do this by promoting a sense of ownership. You can give your input without taking authority away from others, and offer suggestions without steamrolling leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;communication-and-structural-organization&quot;&gt;Communication and structural organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, most systems lean towards disorder and gradual decline. Someone has to take active steps against entropy. Focusing on communication and organization ends up being enormously useful and prevents fragmentation. Look for inefficiencies in how teams are organized, and how information flows through your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-the-architecture-right&quot;&gt;Get the architecture right&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where your &lt;a href=&quot;http://hammad.ca/blog/2017/08/26/engineering-mental-models&quot;&gt;engineering chops will come in handy&lt;/a&gt;. From a technical perspective, getting the core pieces of the architecture right ends up being critical and defines the flow of information in the system. This applies for both front-end and back-end systems. By the way, this doesn’t mean that you should only focus on high-level objectives. Someone smart once told me to “Focus on the high level picture, and the low level details. Things in the middle take care of themselves”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-not-try-to-be-efficient-with-relationships&quot;&gt;Do not try to be efficient with relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an engineer your brain is optimized to seek efficiency. Efficiency is not a good approach when it comes to relationships with people; you can often have the opposite effect as what you intended. I have found that 30 minute meetings are too fast for 1-1s with your reports. What you want to do is to give some time for banter, and a free flow of information. This eases people up and you have better conversations and people often end up sharing more critical information than they otherwise would. Of course, you don’t want to spend a lot of time in meetings so I prefer to have longer infrequent meetings instead of frequent short meetings. This also applies to pushing for changes or influencing others in any way. This is a long game, and you should be prepared for that. Permanent positive behavioral changes take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hire-smart-people-who-gets-stuff-done-and-you-want-to-be-around&quot;&gt;Hire smart people, who gets stuff done, and you want to be around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Naval (@naval) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103969781448704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring, when done right, is one of the highest-leverage activities that you can work on. You are looking for three key signals when hiring: smart, gets stuff done, and good to be around. When looking for the “smart” signal, be aware of the “halo effect” and be weary of charmers. “Get stuff done” is critical because you don’t want to be around smart people who are not adding value to your company. Just like investing, your aim should be to identify people on a great trajectory. “Good to be around” is tricky because it’s filled with personal bias. A good rule is to never hire assholes. Even if they are smart and get stuff done, they will do that at the expense of others, and wreak havoc on the team’s culture. Avoid. Focus on hiring people that you would want long term relationships with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-useful&quot;&gt;Be useful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could behave in a number of different ways at any given time or interaction. What you want is to be useful and add value: there is a useful way of giving feedback to someone that reports to you, there is a useful way to review code, and you can apply this to yourself and plan your day to be more useful to others. Our default instinct is to seek confirmation bias and think about how we are right. We don’t give others the same courtesy. The right approach is to reverse that default instinct: Think ‘how can I make this work’  for other people, and ‘how can this be wrong’ for your own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not compete with your reports either. As a manager, this is particularly important because you want to grow your reports. Be aware of situations or cases where you might be competing, and default to being useful instead of pushing your own agenda. I recommend reading “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13425570-how-will-you-measure-your-life&quot;&gt;How Will You Measure Your Life?&lt;/a&gt;” if you want to dig into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-the-requirements-right-early-and-come-up-with-a-game-plan&quot;&gt;Get the requirements right early and come up with a game-plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning gets a bad rep but it ends up being critical in the long term. Doing &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; planning almost always ends up being much better than no planning at all. What you want to do is plan until you have a general direction defined, and start iterating towards that. The following questions end up being really useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the things that we would want in the near future? You want to pick the path that gives you the most options for the expected future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How could this be wrong? Counteract your confirmation bias with this question by explicitly thinking about failure modes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where do you not want to go? Inversion ends up being really useful. It is easier to avoid stupidity than seeking brilliance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What happens once you get there? Seek second order effects. What will one path unlock  or limit?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What other paths could you take? Has your team settled on a local maxima and not the global maxima?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a decent idea of how to proceed with this, you should be responsible for communicating this plan with the rest of the team too. Not getting the requirements right early on means that your team could potentially end up going in the wrong direction which ends up being a net negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;establish-rapport-before-getting-to-work&quot;&gt;Establish rapport before getting to work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be much more effective at work if you connect with the other people before getting to work; this could mean banter, or just listening — there is a reason why people small-talk.  Get in the circle before attempting to change the circle. This will lead to numerous positive improvements in your workflow. Slack conversations will sound like conversations instead of arguments and you’ll assume positive intent.  You will also find that getting alignment in meetings, and nudging reports towards positive changes ends up being much more useful this way. Icebreakers in meetings and  room for silliness helps here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-no-one-size-fits-all-approach-to-people-personality-tests-are-good-defaults&quot;&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all approach to people. Personality tests are good defaults&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management is about calibration. You are calibrating  your general approach to others, while calibrating a specific approach to each person. This is really important because an approach that might work for one person will not work on others. You might find that personality tests like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality&quot;&gt;Enneagram&lt;/a&gt; serve as great defaults to approaching a person. Type-5, the investigators, work best when you give them freedom and autonomy. Type-6, the loyalists, typically want frequent feedback and support. Infact, they might feel betrayed when they don’t get the support they need. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/a&gt; miniseries on Netflix is a master class on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-people-to-lead-with-their-strengths-and-address-their-growth-areas-as-a-secondary-priority&quot;&gt;Get people to lead with their strengths, and address their growth areas as a secondary priority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to approach a person’s personal growth. I have found that what works best is first identifying their strengths and areas of improvements. Find people’s strengths and obsessions and point them to that. You have to get people to lead with their strengths. This ends up  being the right approach because it gives people confidence and momentum. Turns out, that this is also how they add the most value. The positive reinforcement from adding value creates a snowball effect, which gives the person more motivation and momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a person has momentum, they’ll be much more open to addressing any areas of improvement. You should work with your reports to come up with a game plan for this. Ideally, one should be a master at their specialty domain (e.g., backend or front-end), be great at any adjacent skills (e.g., communication, team-work, product or design), and smooth out their rough edges (e.g., improving how they handle stress, confidence or blindspots).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-the-positives-and-dont-over-index-on-the-negatives&quot;&gt;Focus on the positives, and don’t over index on the negatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, we tend to focus on the negatives more than we should. This might be related to “deprival super reaction syndrome” where we hate losing more than we like winning. In management, this means that we might have the proclivity to focus on what people are doing poorly instead of what they are doing well. This means that people may not feel appreciated if you only focus on the negatives. I believe this also means that we focus on improving low-performers more than amplifying high-performers. Amplifying high-performers might have an order of magnitude higher impact based on the pareto principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-will-act-like-owners-if-you-give-them-control-and-transparency&quot;&gt;People will act like owners if you give them control and transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be transparent, and don’t do everything yourself. Talk to people and make them feel included. When people feel left out of the loop, they generally grow more anxious as they feel that they are losing control. Your ideal case is that your teammates act like owners. You can do this by being transparent about how decisions are made. You also have to &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; others control and autonomy. Expect some mistakes as they calibrate their judgement and nudge in the right direction instead of steamrolling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other times where you’ll have to act like an owner and lead by example. One hint of this case will be when you have a nagging feeling about something that you don’t want to do. Ultimately, the right thing here is to take full ownership, and not ask others to do what you wouldn’t want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-high-standards-for-yourself-and-the-people-around-you&quot;&gt;Have high standards for yourself and the people around you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech markets and products are generally winner-take-all. This means that second place is not a viable option; wInning, in tech, leads to disproportionately greater rewards. Aim to be the best in the world in your space and iterate towards that. There is no point in doing things in a mediocre way.  Aiming high, and having high standards is what pushes everything forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this happen, you need to partner with people who expect more from you. You should also have high standards for your teammates. One interesting outcome of this is that you get the positive effects of the Pygmalion effect: people will rise to your positive expectations. This probably sounds corny, but I have found the Pygmalion effect to be consistently useful. Seeing people transform into their best self ends up being incredibly gratifying as a manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hold-people-accountable&quot;&gt;Hold people accountable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things don’t get delivered, or when you see bad behavior, you have to have high standards and hold people accountable. If you don’t, that’s an implicit message that these bad outcomes are ok. There are many cases where not holding others accountable could have a spiraling effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your approach to this has to be calibrated for your work style and the situation. Ultimately, you should enforce all deal-breaker rules. Set clear expectations early on. When something goes wrong, work with the other person or team to understand why. Was it a technical issue, does the tooling need to be improved or was it an issue with leadership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having more context on your reports work and responsibility ends up being really useful for this. I recommend skimming over their pull requests over the last quarter, looking for documents or planning artifacts that they created, and doing occasional peer-reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bring-other-people-up-with-you&quot;&gt;Bring other people up with you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like working with great and ambitious people because they raise the bar for everyone else. We are allergic to self-obsessed people who only care about their own growth. Your job as a manager is to bring other people up. Do not take credit for work that you did not do, and give recognition to those that did the work. What’s interesting is that most people only really care about their own growth. So being the person who actually spends time thinking about the growth of others differentiates you. Oddly enough, caring about others ends up being a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintain-your-mental-health-with-mindfulness-rest-and-distance&quot;&gt;Maintain your mental health with mindfulness, rest and distance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team’s culture is top down and bottom up. This means people mimic the behavior of others in the position of authority — for better or for worse. You may have noticed your reports mimic your communication nuances. Keeping this in mind, you have to be aware of your own actions. Generally, most people become less aware of their actions as fatigue builds up. Be mindful of your energy levels when entering meetings. Energy and positivity is really awesome, because it’s something that you can give to others, and it doesn’t really cost you anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with stressful situations by adding more emotion generally doesn’t help. One exception to this is when you have to match the other person’s emotions before attemption to defuse situations. Get in the circle before attempting to change the circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aim-to-operate-2-3-months-into-the-future&quot;&gt;Aim to operate 2-3 months into the future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an engineer you typically operate in a scope of days or weeks. As you expand your influence, you also have to start thinking in a greater time horizon. As a manager, your horizon will be longer than a typical engineer, but smaller than someone who focuses on high level strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you need to project your team and reports a few months into the future, and anticipate their challenges. Ideally, you could help resolve these issues before they even happen. This exercise also helps you be more proactive instead of reacting to daily events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-feedback-to-people-that-you-want-long-term-relationships-with&quot;&gt;Give feedback to people that you want long term relationships with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you give feedback to a random stranger doing something that’s bad for them? Probably not. Now, imagine that you knew this person. You would try to reason with this person, and hopefully nudge them in the right direction. You give feedback to people that you care about, and want a long term relationship with. I believe this is also true at work. Even if someone is not your report, it is worth sharing your feedback if you can deliver it usefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving feedback is tricky since people often get defensive. There are different schools of thoughts on this, but I try to build a rapport with someone before giving them direct feedback. Once you can convince someone that you are on their side, people are much more receptive to it. Get in the circle. While code-review feedback is best when it’s all at once, that isn’t necessarily true for 1-1 feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people default to “direct-feedback” and I think that doesn’t work for people you don’t have good rapport with. Ray Dalio (an amazing investor) suggests “Radical Truth” and gives direct feedback at all times. I don’t think this works with most people. That works for him because he is in a position of authority. His investment firm, Bridgewater, also has an incredible turn-over rate and 25% of new-hires leave within 18 months. Build rapport before getting to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-hope-you-found-these-useful-if-you-have-any-questions-or-thoughts-feel-free-to-reach-out-to-me-on-twitter-herehttpstwittercomhammadk-apparently-i-write-one-blog-post-every-three-years-so-see-you-in-2023&quot;&gt;I hope you found these useful.

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Management is really about growing people. It&amp;#39;s fuzzy, and has to be calibrated per person. 6 years into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Shopify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, here are my mental models for management.

   <title>Mental Models for Product Developers, Part 1: Engineering</title>
   <link href="http://hammad.ca/blog/2017/08/26/engineering-mental-models"/>
   <updated>2017-08-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://hammad.ca/blog/2017/08/26/engineering-mental-models</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s always new &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;: new frameworks, new languages, and new platforms. All of this adds up. Sometimes it feels like you are just treading water, and not actually getting better at what you do. I have tried spending more time on this stuff, but that doesn’t work — there is always more. I have found that a better approach is learning things at a deeper level, and using those lessons as a checklist. This checklist of core principles is called mental models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whenever you come across a new problem, you consult your mental models to make sure that you have covered your bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about this approach by studying how bright people think. You might have heard about Richard Feynman describe the handful of algorithms that he applies to everything. You might have also seen Elon Musk refer to this as thinking by fundamental principles. Charlie Munger also credits most of his financial success to mental models. All of these people are amazing and you won’t get to their level with mental models, but mental models will give you a nudge in the right direction. Below are the engineering mental models that I have learned after working at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoid-silent-failures&quot;&gt;Avoid silent failures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something breaks you should hear about it. This is important because small issues can help you find larger structural issues. Silent failures typically happen when exceptions are silenced — this may be in a networking library, or the code that handles exceptions. One of my slack bots stopped posting recently and it was because the API credentials were revoked. The networking library I used swallowed the exception so I didn’t hear about this for a while. To fix this, i started checking the status of each network request and made sure that future failures raised an exception. Failures can also be silent when one of your servers is down. You can prevent this by using a third party system that pings each of the critical components. As your project gets more mature, setup a dashboard to track key metrics and create an alert for anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scaling-reads-with-caching--denormalizing&quot;&gt;Scaling reads with caching &amp;amp; denormalizing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read-heavy systems mean that some data is being read multiple times. This can be problematic because your database might not have enough capacity to deal with all of that work. The general approach of solving this is by pre-computing this data and storing it somewhere fast. Denormalizing is the process of pre-computing data. In practice this means that instead of letting each request hit multiple tables in a database, you pre-compute the expected response and store it in a single place. Ideally, you should store this information that is really fast to read from (think RAM). In practice this means storing data in data stores like Memcached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scaling-writes-with-sharding-nosql-datastore-or-design-choices&quot;&gt;Scaling writes with sharding, NoSQL datastore or design choices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write-heavy systems tend to be very difficult to deal with. Traditional relational databases can handle reads pretty well, but have trouble with writes. They take more time processing writes because relational databases spend more effort on things like data consistency. This can be very problematic because your database can lock up and give you a lot of timeouts. Consider the scenario where a traditional database can handle 10 writes per second (and you can’t scale up anymore). One method of dealing with this is by writing data to multiple databases. Sharding is the process where you split your database into multiple parts (known as shards). This process allows you to group related data into one database. Another method of dealing with a write heavy system is by writing to Non-relational (NoSQL) databases. These databases are optimized to handle writes, but there is a tradeoff. Depending on the type of NoSQL database, it gives up atomic transactions (they don’t wait for other transactions to finish), consistency across multiple clusters (they don’t wait for other clusters to have the same data), or it’s less durable (they don’t spend time writing to disk). This may seem like you are giving up a lot, but you can mitigate some of these losses with design choices. Design choices can also help you cover some of the weaknesses of SQL databases. For example, consider that updating rows is much more expensive than creating new rows. Design your system so that you are storing new data by inserting new rows, and not by updating existing ones. With all of that said, I recommend that you start out with a SQL database, and evolve your setup depending on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-minimal-up-front-work-and-queue-the-rest&quot;&gt;Do minimal up front work and queue the rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system is scalable when it can handle unexpectedly large bursts of incoming requests. The faster your system handles a request, the faster it can get to the next one. Turns out, that in most cases, you don’t have to give a response to the request right away — just a response indicating that you have started working on the task. In practice, this means queueing a background job after you have received a request. Once your job is in a queue, you have the added benefit of making your system fault tolerant since failed jobs can be tried again. An alternative to queues is setting up a publish-subscribe system like Kafka. The benefit of this approach is that you can send one request to different type of systems: one system immediately processes the request, while the second system runs a long term data analysis job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;horizontal-scaling&quot;&gt;Horizontal scaling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizontal scaling refers to running your software on multiple small machines, while vertical scaling refers to running your software on one large machine. Horizontal scaling is more fault tolerant since failure of a machine does not mean an outage; instead, the work for the failed machine is routed to the other machines. In practice, horizontally scaling a system is the only long term approach to scaling. All systems that appear ‘infinitely-scalable’ are horizontally scaled under the hood: Cloud object stores like S3 and GCS, NoSQL databases like Bigtable and Dynamo DB, and stream processing software like Kafka are all horizontally scaled. The cost for horizontally scaling systems is application and operational complexity, but there are ways of hiding this from developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-are-harder-to-test-are-more-likely-to-break&quot;&gt;Things that are harder to test are more likely to break&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among competing approaches to a problem, you should pick the most testable solution (this is my variant of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam’s Razor&lt;/a&gt;). If something is difficult to test, people tend to avoid testing it. This means that future programmers (or you) will be less likely to fully test this system, and each change will make the system more brittle. This model is important to remember when you first tackle a problem because good testability needs to be baked into the architecture. You’ll know when something is hard to test because your intuition will tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anti-fragility-and-root-cause-analysis&quot;&gt;Anti-fragility and root cause analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s uses the analogy of a Hydra in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0083DJWGO&quot;&gt;Anti-Fragile&lt;/a&gt;; hydras grow a back a stronger head every time they are struck. The software industry has championed this idea too. Instead of treating failures as shameful incidents that should be avoided at all costs, they are now treated as opportunities to improve the system. Netflix’s engineering team is known for Chaos Monkey, a resiliency system that turns off random components. Once you anticipate random events, you can build a more resilient system. When failures do happen they are treated as an opportunity to learn. Root cause analysis is a process where the people involved in the failure try to extract the root cause of the failure in a blameless way — starting of by what went right, and then diving into the failure without blaming anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-o-and-exponential-growth&quot;&gt;Big-O and exponential growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big-O notation describes the growth in complexity of an algorithm. There is a lot to this, but you’ll get very far if you just understand the difference between constant, linear and exponential growth. In layman’s terms, algorithms that perform one task are better than algorithms that perform many tasks; and the later algorithm is better than algorithms where the number of tasks are ever increasing with each iteration. In practice you’ll almost never see a block of code with multiple nested for-loops — which is typically what one thinks of when they think Big-O. Instead, I have found this issue is typically visible at an architectural level with nested callbacks or background jobs. Watch out for those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;margin-of-safety&quot;&gt;Margin of safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accounting for a margin of safety means that you need to leave some room for errors or exceptional events. For example, you might be tempted to run each server at 90% of its capacity. While this saves money, it can leave your server vulnerable to spikes in traffic. You might have more confidence in your setup if you have auto-scaling setup; there is a problem with this too. Your overworked server might cause cascading failures in the whole system. By the time auto-scaling kicks in, the new server may have disk, connection pool or an assortment of other random fun issues. Expect the unexpected and give yourself some room to breathe. Margin of safety also applies to planning releases of new software. You should add a buffer of time because unexpected things will come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;protect-the-public-api&quot;&gt;Protect the public API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be very careful when making changes to the public API. Once something is in the public API, it is very difficult to change or remove. In practice this means having a very good reason for your changes, and being very careful with anything that effects external developers; mistakes in this type of work effect numerous people and are very difficult to revert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;redundancy&quot;&gt;Redundancy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any system with many moving parts should be built to expect failures of individual parts. In practice this means having backup providers for systems like Memcached or Redis. For permanent data-stores like SQL, fail-overs and backups are critical. Keep in mind that you should not consider something a backup unless you do regular drills to make sure that you can actually recover that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;loose-coupling--services&quot;&gt;Loose coupling &amp;amp; services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tight coupling means that different components of a system are closely interconnected. This has two major drawbacks. The first drawback is that these tightly coupled systems are more complex. Complex systems, in turn, are more difficult to maintain and more error prone. The second major draw back of these systems is that failure in one component propagates faster. When systems are loosely coupled, this means that failures can be self contained and can be replaced by potential backups (see Redundancy). At a code level, reducing tight coupling means following the single responsibility principles which states that every class should have a single responsibility and should communicate with other classes with a minimal public API. At an architecture level, you can improve tightly coupled systems by following the Service oriented architecture. This architecture system suggests dividing components by their business services and only allowing communication between these services with a strict API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-serious-about-configuration&quot;&gt;Be serious about configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most failures in well-tested systems occur due to bad configuration; this can be changes like environmental variables updates or DNS settings. Configuration changes are particularly error prone because of the lack of tests, and the difference between the development and production environment. In practice, this means adding tests to cover different configuration, and making the dev and prod environment as similar as possible. If something works in development, but not production, spend sometime thinking about why that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;explicit-is-better-than-implicit&quot;&gt;Explicit is better than implicit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model is one of the core tenants from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3&quot;&gt;Zen of Python&lt;/a&gt; and it’s critical to improving code readability. It is really difficult to understand code that expects the reader to have all of the context of the original author. An engineer should be able to look at class and understand where all of the different components come from. I have found that simply having everything in one place is better than convoluted design patterns. Write code for people, not computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-review&quot;&gt;Code review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code review is an amazing practice because it maintains code quality and transfers knowledge from senior developers. Have at-least two other developers review your code before shipping it. You’ll find that your code review quality will slip depending on your energy level. Here is an approach to getting some consistency in reviews: 1) Why is this change being made? 2) How can this approach or code be wrong?  3) Do the tests cover this or do I need to run it locally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perceived-performance&quot;&gt;Perceived Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on UX research, 0.1 second (100ms) is the gold standard of loading time. Slower applications risk losing the user’s attention. Accomplishing this load time for non-trivial apps is actually pretty difficult. This is where you can take advantage of perceived performance. Perceived performance refers to how your fast your product feels. The idea is that you show users placeholder content at load time, and then add the actual content on the screen once it finishes loading. This is kinda related to the Do minimal up front work and queue the rest model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;safety-valves&quot;&gt;Safety valves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a system means accounting for all possibilities. In addition to worst case scenarios, you have to be prepared to deal with things that you cannot anticipate. The general approach for handling these scenarios is stopping the system to prevent any possible damage. In practice, this means having controls that let you reject additional requests while you diagnose a solution; one way to do this is adding an environment variable that can be toggled without deploying a new version of your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;failure-modes&quot;&gt;Failure modes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers and product folks focus on the expected use cases. As an engineer you also have to think about the worst case scenarios because that’s where the majority of your time will go. At scale, all bad things that can happen do happen. Asking “What could go wrong” or “How can I be wrong” really helps with this; these questions also cancel out our bias towards confirmation of our existing ideas. Think about what happens when no data, or a lot of data is flowing through the system (Think “Min-Max”). You should expect computers to ocassionally die and handle those cases gracefully, and expect network requests to be slow or stall all togther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;computers-should-tell-you-when-something-is-wrong&quot;&gt;Computers should tell you when something is wrong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems become more difficult to monitor as they grow. What you want is to measure and log everything at the very beginning, and not wait until something goes wrong. You can encourage other developers to do this by creating services with a really simple APIs since these easy and obvious services are more likely to be used. Once you are logging everything, create automated alerts for anomolies. Post these alerts in shared communication channels, and automatically page the oncall developer for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automatic-cache-expiration&quot;&gt;Automatic cache expiration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your caching setup can be greatly simplified with automatic cache expiration. To illustrate why, consider the example where the server is rendering a product on a page. You would want to expire the cache whenever this product changes. The manual method of doing this is by calling the cache expiration code after the product is changed. This requires two seperate steps, 1) Changing the product, and then 2) Expiring the cache. If you build your system with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;key-based&lt;/code&gt; caching, you can avoid the second step all together. This is typically done by using a combination of the product’s ID and it’s ‘last_updated_at_timestamp’ as the key for the product’s cache. This means that when a product changes it’ll have a different ‘last_updated_at_timestamp’ field. Since you’ll have a different key, you won’t find anything in the cache matching that key and fetch the product in it’s newest state. The downside of this approach is that your cache datastore (e.g., Memcached or Redis) will fill up with old caches. This can be mitigated by adding an expiry time to all caches so old caches automatically disappear. You can also configure Memcached so it evicts the oldest caches to make room for new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-new-tech-should-make-an-impossible-task-possible-or-something-10x-easier&quot;&gt;Introducing new tech should make an impossible task possible, or something 10x easier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies eventually have to evaluate new technologies. In the
tech industry, you have to do this to stay relevant. However, introducing a new
technology has two negative consequences. First, it becomes more
difficult for developers to move across teams. This is a problem because it
creates knowledge silos within the company, and slows down career growth.
The second consequence is that fewer libraries or learnings can be
shared across the company because of the tech fragmentation.
Moving over to a new tech might come up because of people’s tendency to want to start over and write things from scratch. Doing this is almost always a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/&quot;&gt;bad idea&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, there are a few cases where introducing a new technology makes sense. It makes sense when it enables your company to take on previously impossible tasks. It makes sense when the technical limitation of your current stack is preventing you from reaching your product goals.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Automatically run Rails database migration after deploying to Heroku</title>
   <link href="http://hammad.ca/blog/2016/02/15/automatically-migrating-your-rails-app-on-heroku"/>
   <updated>2016-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://hammad.ca/blog/2016/02/15/automatically-migrating-your-rails-app-on-heroku</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Buildpacks are scripts that run after your app is deployed to Heroku. Heroku is
smart enough to figure out what buildpacks to use depending on your app. For
example, assets are automatically prepared when you deploy your Rails app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/buildpacks-per-platform.png&quot; alt=&quot;Heroku Buildpacks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For added functionality, Heroku lets you add additional buildpacks.
So, to automatically run any pending database migration after your Rails app
deploys:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to your app’s directory and run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku buildpacks&lt;/code&gt; to see the list of
current buildpacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a rake tasks buildpack with: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/gunpowderlabs/buildpack-ruby-rake-deploy-tasks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure this buildpack: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku config:set DEPLOY_TASKS='db:migrate cache:clear'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are all done! Any pending migrations will automatically run the next
time you deploy to Heroku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heroku Buildpacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gunpowderlabs/buildpack-ruby-rake-deploy-tasks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ruby rake buildpack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Confirm before pushing to Git master branch</title>
   <link href="http://hammad.ca/blog/2015/03/08/confirm-before-pushing-to-master-branch"/>
   <updated>2015-03-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://hammad.ca/blog/2015/03/08/confirm-before-pushing-to-master-branch</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/git-push-force.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;git push force&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard horror stories about developers accidentally force pushing to the
master branch of their project. This can be very difficult to revert, but
luckily this can be avoided using a Git pre-push hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pre-push hook is just a script that lives in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git/hooks/*&lt;/code&gt; directory.
It is run every time you push to your Git repository. I have edited the script
to prompt you for a confirmation before you push to the master branch. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Are you sure you want to push to &quot;master&quot; ? (y/n):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the code below to you project’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git/hooks/pre-hook&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the script executable with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-hook&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try this out my making a &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; change in one of the directories above and
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Optional) If you want this hook in all git projects by default, try out &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/8842663&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;git templating.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-code&quot;&gt;The code:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I examinded the link between software quality and user reviews during my
master’s. This was really interesting because it involved doing static analysis on code
which is very objective and comparing that with user feedback which is really subjective.

   <title>LookRook: A Rails app for finding the best stylists in your hometown</title>
   <link href="http://hammad.ca/projects/2014/02/01/lookrook"/>

   <id>http://hammad.ca/projects/2014/02/01/lookrook</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This idea for this app is really simple; make it super easy for stylists to upload pictures of their work online (and establish their portfolio). On the other hand, make it really easy for users to find the best stylists in their home town, based on the photos uploaded by the stylists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, If someone wants to get a new &lt;em&gt;layered&lt;/em&gt; haircut, they’d look for images in the layered category and find images from different stylists. They are also able to sort these images based on their popularity, and the location of the stylist.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Wordpress to Jekyll</title>
   <link href="http://hammad.ca/blog/2012/09/02/Wordpress-to-Jekyll"/>
   <updated>2012-09-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://hammad.ca/blog/2012/09/02/Wordpress-to-Jekyll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I movedthis website from WordPress to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is a Ruby static-site generator which turns your text files into related HTML files. So far, I love it. Since all the files that Jekyll generates are just HTML files, I don’t have to worry about a database or any sort of maintenance issues. Even better, I can now host this blog on Github, or Amazon S3, for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wordpressvsjekyll.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wordpress vs Jekyll&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Theatrical Poster from the Library of Congress, Image Library&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has used WordPress, or any other  CMS platform, for a personal site for a while understands that it requires frequent maintenance. While WordPress is great at many tasks, the frequent updates and security issues get annoying after a while. On top of that, you can’t simply edit files in your text editor. Recently I stumbled into Jekyll which is the Ruby static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my main concerns while using WordPress was backing up data. Since Jekyll simply works with text files, this means that I can now keep these files &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; I like. So I keep all the files for this website in a Dropbox folder so that all changes automagically get synced across different computers –  this is awesome! When working with Jekyll you create and edit simple text files and, based on your templates, Jekyll processes them and turns them into interconnected html files. All of the generated files are kept in a folder which can be deployed onto Github or your own private server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploying&quot;&gt;Deploying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editing and deploying the changes to this blog are probably my favorite reasons for switching to Jekyll. Once I have edited the text files that I need, I add these changes to git and push to the git remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Edit the files and have Jekyll update the deployment folder
&lt;/span&gt;
jekyll build
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;_site
git add .
git commit
git push &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#That's it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While WordPress and similar platforms are great for most users, those that prefer the peace of mind of working with simple text files should check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I meant for this to be a personal home page but planned on later expanding it to allow others to pick their own RSS feeds. In mid 2010 I had a few thousand regular users but eventually there was a sharp decline because of better web apps like Netvibes.com and Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sosmos.com, in web terms, has since been sunset. If you are interested in a great app that lets you pull content from different websites I recommend &lt;a title=&quot;NetVibes&quot; href=&quot;http://www.netvibes.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Netvibes&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a super exciting project and I got to work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://toastygames.com/parallax/&quot;&gt;Zi Ye&lt;/a&gt; on different iterations of it —  imagine my excitement when &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20003598-1.html&quot;&gt;CNET&lt;/a&gt; published an article about our project. You can read the full paper &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/pdf/cobra.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or on ACM &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1754154&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We discuss Cobra, a handheld peripheral for computer games that applies flexible display design principles to provide a highly intuitive, mobile gaming experience. Cobra is a flexible cardboard interface that uses bends as input to the gaming device. Images are provided through projection with a shoulder-mounted pico projector. In this paper, we will present our prototype, the motives behind it, and its immediate applications.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was a member of the group that organized CEEC in 2010 and I developed their web presence for this that year. CEEC 2010 was an amazing opportunity to meet entrepreneurs in the energy field an I think it may have been responsible for my save-the-world-esque ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I setup an app that accepted payments from Paypal for online registration and created a website that I had been obsessing over for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
